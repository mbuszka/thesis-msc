I transform a manual derivation technique known as the functional correspondence between evaluators and abstract machines into a robust algorithm.

I begin by describing the classic formulation of the methodology consisting of two source-to-source human-aided transformations and characterize control-flow analysis as a basis for their algorithmization.
I then define the meta-language \IDL{} and present the three main steps of the automatic procedure: transformation to administrative normal form, selective transformation to continuation-passing style and selective defunctionalization.
I also derive a procedure for computing control-flow analysis of programs in \IDL{} using the abstracting abstract machines methodology.

The thesis is accompanied by an implementation of the algorithm in the form of a command-line tool.
It allows for automatic transformation of an interpreter embedded in a \textit{Racket} source file and gives fine-grained control over the resulting machine.
I present a selection of case-studies which showcase the performance of the tool and the algorithm by deriving both known and novel abstract machines.
